{"name":"So, You're Getting a Website","tagline":"A client introduction to owning a website.","body":"# So You're Getting a Website\r\n\r\n## About this Book\r\n\r\nThis book has been made over time as we have been responding to clients questions about getting a website and what they should be aware of. It has grown as a resource and we wanted to make it available to clients before they were getting started with a new website.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nI have spent hours writing emails to clients detailing the ins-and-outs of gaining returns for the websites I have created for them. After a while I knew I writing the same things over and over again and it was time to put the words into one place, with the aim of becoming a pamphlet I can hand out to clients before we work together.\r\n\r\n## What?\r\n\r\nOwning a website is hard work, especially if you expect it to bring returns. I have found that clients expect a website to do all the work for them, without realising it is just another tool in their marketing strategy; You only get out of it what you put into it. Just getting a website online is not a magic bullet solution to attracting clients, it is when the hard work actually begins.\r\n\r\nIt can be nicer to know the number of circles you must pass through to get to the centre, this pamphlet aims to explain - in some broad sense - the depths of work required to get a website to be an excellent marketing tool, rather than a mediocre business site.\r\n\r\n## Errors\r\n\r\nIf you find anything in need of correction, or that is technically wrong, please email me james at frodosghost dot com to inform me.\r\n\r\n## Licence\r\n\r\n<span xmlns:dct=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\" property=\"dct:title\">So, You're Getting a Website</span> by <a xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" href=\"http://frodosghost.com\" property=\"cc:attributionName\" rel=\"cc:attributionURL\">James Rickard</a> is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License</a>.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
