# Getting Clients

In which we discuss the methods and ideas behind getting clients.



A website is a great platform to show off your company or product. It is a great way to connect with your clients and present something that people can not live life without. But let us say it again; it is not a magical tool that makes customers appear from thin air.

Clients are attracted to companies that display the same values they believe in. That is why a website is an important and now essential tool to have in your belt but trusting the website to bring you clients is like trusting a hammer to be every tool a carpenter needs to do the job - the hammer may get the job done on occasion but the other times you will be bewildered as to why it is not working.

A website should fit within your marketing that you are currently using to bring in clients. If you consider it involved then you are more likely to treat it like a tool you cannot live without.

> A well-oiled marketing machine has many cogs. Your website is just one of them; it may be the biggest cog, but it is still a single part that makes the machine run.

## Word of Mouth Still Rules the Roost

Your best and most successful way of finding clients will still come from word-of-mouth. It is the best and most flattering way to gain clients and, with your normal client screening process, should get you some really good, long term clients.

Word-of-mouth is when you work for a client and they like what you do so much that they recommend you to a friend, or someone who asks about the services you offer. It is how we find our most important personal connections, from doctors to good friends and it is a very powerful advertisement.

This is the best kind of marketing; it is free and based on the existing services you offer. Look after these clients, because word will get around and you will end up with a fantastic list of clients that will grow like a ripple effect in a pond.

There are exceptions to this, but for most smaller businesses it is the general rule.

## So why do you need a website if you get the majority of your clients through referrals?

A website shows that your business exists, if you do not show up in any search results when someone is looking for your services then you are missing out on potential revenue. *Having a website gives you a chance to be seen*.

You give your business an easy way to share information. Instead of printing off large brochures you can direct people to you site for the same information, that can be kept updated. By putting your information onto a website *you are publishing to a canonical source of information about your business*.

The locale of your business might not matter, so by having a website *you give yourself a potential client base that exists within the whole world*.

Even if you do not invest millions of dollars into a site to start off with, you can still get a feel for how the internet works and how you can exist within it. Over time *you can expand your business and use the website as a source of revenue* by taking one step at a time.

## It Takes Time to Understand

Not many websites have the immediate money earning potential. It takes time for a website to find it's footing, for you the learn how your clients will use the site, where to put money in to make it better. It will take time to learn how to make the site better and bring you clients. Every site is different.

Do not be discouraged by a poorly performing website. Do some investigation, find how to make it better, find how to connect with your clients. You will be more likely to find more clients if you learn how to speak to them and connect with them.

Most of the time we have to change how we think what our clients are thinking - to unlearn our misconceptions about our clients - and to listen to them. Not to think on behalf of our clients but be able to have a conversation with them.


## The Best Sites Change with the Times

A very small percentage of sites will "go viral", some of us will have to suffer making the hard road to generate a small income from our website. It will be a small income if we are lucky too, the majority will have to spend time and effort making a site that very few potential people will find.

It is depressing to think of the numbers, very early on we may be lucky to see any clients find the site, most of the people who will see our brand new website will be family and friends. There is always a long road ahead of us, but leaving a site to go stale will only aid the sinking ship.

Stale websites fade from search engine ranking systems. Stale websites appear uncared for; there is nothing worse than finding a really good article only to find they have not updated the site in the past seven months. A current Facebook profile does not count towards your website appearing well in search results.

Always keep your site up-to-date. It shows clients that you care about connecting with them. Check your analytics to see where clients are going on your site and improve those pages. Remove or improve the dark corners that aren't getting visitors. Be mindful of your website and you will appear mindful of your clients and help them to connect with you.

Design refreshes and small changes to the layout will keep your regular visitors looking for new things with your site. Just like changes in a static display at your local supermarket will make you look twice and take notice, so will small changes to your site.

## How about the Tyre Kickers?

Tyre Kickers are people who are window shopping but not making commitments to using your services; they visit your site but don't fill out forms or send emails. One of the problems is that we can never tell the serious clients from those who are trying to price the market, from those who were never intending to buy.

Tyre kickers include:

* People who were going to use your information but not your services;
* People who are on the fence and not sure;
* Those who were never going to use your services.

It may feel like the Tyre Kickers are a waste of resources. All the helpful articles you spend hours crafting, all of the resources you put together and share with them and they never go a step further to share with their friends. When you check your tracking information it appears that you are going nowhere to gaining more followers.

There will always be freeloaders, but if you change how you think about them maybe you can gain their trust and they could become helpful.

Consider these Blank Analytic People as a target market and try to change little things to connect with them. Use analytics to find out which pages the search engines are directing people. Update little panels on your site answer questions. Update your content to check if it is flat in certain areas. Try A/B testing landing pages to see if you get a different reaction.

## Path of Least Resistance

We like overcomplicating solutions. We like offering a website that is large because we think that our potential clients will visit every page before using us a s a service provider.

In reality web searching is a vein experience. Clients can walk away from your site because it is not colourful enough, or because it is too colourful. They can walk away because the text is too small, or the site design isn't polished enough by their standards. Many people can walk away because a site is too complicated.

Trust that you clients will read everything about you, but make sure you offer the path of least resistance in making contact with you. Consider creating a mailing list with your latest updates excerpted in a monthly email. Include special offers to only mailing list subscribers to encourage people to give you their email address.

People within the industry of marketing call it "converting". Your main aim of advertising is to convert the visitors, potential clients of all varieties, into paying clients. Because of the limitless possibilities of having a website and the tools that can be created within a digital world, we tend to over think the simple solutions. It is the possibilities that lead to overcomplicating.

Your website should facilitate contact not hinder it. Your website should encourage sharing not hide it below unimportant information. Do not complicate the simple focus of converting visitors into clients. Over time you should iron out the complexities and aim to make the website a simple tool for having clients get in contact with you.

## What Does Social Media have to Do With This?

Social media is a massive marketing platform that should not be ignored when getting your website setup. There are many professionals that will tell you how to use social media successfully and get good results from it.

To best bypass the hype and rush into Social Media some sensibility is a good idea. Make sure that you consider who has access within your company to post on social media, keep it current with what you are posting and direct people to your website.

Remember that while you can build a large profile on social media sites, it is not your website to control. You have agreed to their terms and conditions, you have subjected your advertising to their pathways. When they change something it effects how you run your business and while you may be happy to run inside their structure you should always be able to control it yourself.

Invest in social media but make sure that it leads people back to the canonical source of information about your company, your website.
