# Tracking and Measurement

By tracking and measuring the performance of your website we can gauge how many readers are responding to your site, the pages they are visiting and if we are getting the desired results.

We have previously talked about responding to the usage of your site by watching what has been seen. How do we do that, considering we cannot look over your clients’ shoulders?We have previously talked about responding to the usage of your site by watching what has been seen. How do we do that, considering we cannot look over your clients’ shoulders?

## Enter the Analytics Tools

The performance of your website can be tracked via analytics tools, most of which are available for free (a list is provided at the end of the chapter). These analytics services are implemented on your website and record statistics about each visit to your website. This statistical data can be used to get a birds-eye-view of how your website is being used and to find where changes should be made.

All of the analytical information can be valuable to you in terms of how things should be on your website. Most sites will have this set up when it is built and launched. If it’s not, then don't waste time and get it setup on your live website, now. Analytical information will be invaluable in teaching you how people are using your website.

Recording this information and doing nothing with it will not profit your business. Adjustments will need to be made to the website to stay within your marketing scheme. So how do we use this information to profit you and your business?

## What are Analytics Tools?

Web analytics is a cross between mathematics and a scientific experiment. You begin with a website designed to fit within your marketing strategy, developed from a good proposal and released to the internet. Over the next few months you would like to see how your website has performed with visitors and how they have been browsing your site.

Analytics tools do not track each user as an individual; rather they group the usage data from a span of time and show you how the website was used. In this way an individual user is not seen as an individual. They are seen as "Data" and it is easier to watch and statistically analyse Data than it is to follow an individual user's patterns.

By looking at the overview of Data you can see how the majority have seen your website, how many people saw new articles or pages you were linking to on social media. You can see what was successful in being shared or what pages were not seen at all within a month.

By monitoring the results of changes to your traffic with respect to updates on the website, you can see trends that affect your visitor statistics. By updating the website, you can see the effect that has on gaining new visitors or hopefully gaining new clients.

## It Works Over Time

Like with a good experiment, trends can only be shown over time. It will take months to build up a starting base from when your website is first released. Short term spikes in page views will even out over time, and after a few months you will have general usage statistics for your website.

Once you have the initial statistics of your website you can start making more "sure" thoughts about how people are using it. The analytical data can be used to determine how to change the website so that it will engage more people. This will, in turn, encourage you to make small or large updates to your website and see how those changes affect people. Which is monitored and then updates are made. The circle continues until you hone your message and target market, hopefully engaging more clients along the way.

Ongoing monitoring of this usage data will give you feedback about changes you have made. When changes are made based on data and reason we can feel more sure about getting outcomes. Rather than feeling annoyed by our website providing zero results, the data becomes our support structure for making changes and updates. This is why monitoring the statistics is an important part of running your website.

## What Are We Looking For?

Consider what results you want from a campaign. Are you after an increasing visitor count each month, or people submitting questions via forms? Do you measure clicks to social media to share articles, or clicks from social media to read articles as more of a success? How do you want your website to be used by clients and what do you call "success" for the investment you put into your website?

These questions should be considered by your business. Success comes in many shapes and sizes. Results that you will want to see will be different from month to month as you change your marketing focus.

You need to determine what results you are looking for, as it will change how you present your website. Primarily you want people to visit the website, as it means you were a relevant search result, but visitors do not necessarily pay the bills. You are probably looking for visitors to become paying clients as the main goal.

Remember analytics will not show how individuals became a client, but trends and pathways the majority of people walked upon, so use the trends and pathways to your advantage to guides visitors to be clients.

## How Do We Get Results?

While we cannot get specific about getting results for your website, there are a few things to keep in mind when looking at your analytics and statistical data.

### Read and Follow

Data happens and you should trust it for what it is: a broad stroke view of how users are using your website. Don't guess browsing patterns. Take it as it is and make changes according to what you see.

> You are creating your website for your users, so serve their needs and interests.

We still like to guess what our users are getting from our site. We cannot get inside their minds to understand what they see. That is not our job. Every user has different intentions when they visit your site, which is why following the statistics makes sense. If you were after one user you approach them directly.

Following the statistics allows us to see what is generally happening with the site, trial changes to see if it affects browsing patterns, and make changes to engage more visitors.

By getting dwelling on the usage of a single user we can miss the overall focus of what we are achieving.

### Change is as Good as a Holiday

To find what works, you will have to change your website. Update images, change layouts, move icons around. Watch what resonates with the statistics and keep that in place. Small changes that are monitored over time will produce a website that your clients will use.

Some of these changes may not be liked by the business but if it resonates with the users you are on the right track. You may not like things that the users do. Instead of removing something you do not like from the site, try improving or restructuring it until you like it and the client likes it.

### Test Changes for a Month or Two

Do not feel like changes are irreversible. You can test changes for a short time and then revert them if they are not working with users. Not much with your website is set in concrete and most things can be changed.

## Just the Beginning

The world of analytics is broad and there is a whole service industry built around it, so do not take this as the all-in-all solution. Experiment and play with your site and monitor the progress you make attracting more people.

Ongoing analysis and reporting may give you ideas that you would have not otherwise thought of and using the Data can lead to more "sure" outcomes. The long term Data should show the rise and fall of visitors and their engagement with the website. More changes to the site will lead to more visitors coming through the door.
