# Getting Your Website

In this chapter we will be considering if you need a website in the first place.

## Why Do you Need a Website?

As a business it is becoming harder to exist without a website on the internet. People are searching directly online to find their local businesses. While some people rely on old-style search directories, more and more are looking for businesses with search engines like Google, Bing or Yahoo.

The shift away from old-style marketing media, like the “good-old” paper-based search directories, is a move towards an individual taking responsibility for finding providers of the services they need. Gone are the days of big businesses making an annual compendium of local services for you to search from. With people searching directly it is your responsibility to be found when and where they are looking.

> People are changing the ways they look for your skill or service and it is up to you to be found when people go looking.

You need a website to exist in the largest search directories in the world. You need a website because it is an easy way to show what you do to a broader market. With the internet you can broaden your influence, creating a stronger brand for your business.

## Marketing Tool in Your Belt

A good website is a marketing tool. A good website will attract clients, teach people about your services, present a better business facade than your competitors and offer people a way to get in contact with you.

> As soon as you decide to get a website you have made a marketing decision

The creation of a website is an important step because you are expanding the reach of your business. You are choosing to be in charge of the online representation and Digital Brand to build around your business.

## What Does It Cost?

Some providers will give you a website for under $1,000, if you are lucky you could find a provider to sell a website for $500. This will get you online, but it will not guarantee you online success. Getting a website is a long term investment. Good, ongoing returns do not just happen because you own a internet domain, they are established and built as you invest more time and effort into an online presence.

Consider the amount of money your business would invest in a long term marketing campaign, building a successful internet website would be priced similarly. The good thing about a website is that the cost can be spent when you have the money available. You can also invest time and money into areas of the website that are engaging the most people.

The ongoing maintenance costs are essential in establishing a relevant online brand. Most businesses do not account for the additional hours required to keep a site maintained and up-to-date. New posts, writing or sourcing valuable information, engaging with clients, followup from enquiries; all these items add up over time. The initial investment gets you a 'house', then you have to make it your own.

## Do You Really Want a Website?

Before setting out you should weigh the benefits for owning a successful website against the risk and effort - before it costs you money. Owning a website is not a secret key to getting clients, it's an investment, and as such, you should consider it a marketing expense.

Having a website will increase work for you and your company in both time and resources. Not only is there the initial cost of setting up the website, there are ongoing costs for you to keep it updated and relevant.

Start by asking a few questions about your website:

* What would you like to gain from this website?
* How would you like it to perform?
* What will you class as a successful website?
* What will you use to measure the success or failure?

These questions help you to look at the website more as a marketing expense. An untouched website gets a very small return on investment. Your website should be updated frequently to keep it relevant. Remember it is a tool in your belt, not a magic wand.

> Remember: Benefits resulting from the site are directly related to the effort put in.

The ongoings costs should be factored into the running of your business. How do you plan to use your website? Will you update the news regularly? Who will be in charge of updating the website? How will you make people aware of updates? Will staff have hours allocated to update the site?

Take some time to consider the investment. We talk about costs but they are just the beginning, there is a lot of effort the business has to put in to make a return on investment. If it sounds like too much work, then there is little point in continuing down this path. Put your logo onto a white webpage and leave it at that.
