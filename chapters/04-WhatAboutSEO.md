# Optimising for Search Engines

It's here that we discuss Search Engine Optimisation. The good, the bad and the ugly.

Search Engine Optimisation is the process of moving your site up the search result list, hopefully onto the first page, without exchanging money directly with any of the search engine companies to be displayed there.

Displaying towards the top of the search results list shows how relevant or important the page is considered from thousands of pages with similar information. So displaying your website towards the top, or at least on the first page, is the considered better than paying to get there. For this reason it is best to invest in your website and start building your content towards bringing you good results.

To boil down Search Engine Optimisation into a three step process, just to get started, would look something like this:

* Create a site that is easy for search engines to use. Your website can be searched by the "bots" that discover and remember information for search engines;
* Update the content on a regular basis so the search engines know you are relevant;
* Create site content that is compelling to read so people share links to your website.

## How Does Searching Work

When you begin a search for some information, you start with a few words in a small text box. From these few words you started with, the Search Engine has to go and find a small list of sites that best match those terms for you. Each search engine matches the terms differently from another.

From a small amount of words, the Search Engine has to trawl through a lot of content to generate results. Through the use of analysis and algorithms the search engine connects the dots and presents you with a list of websites that it deems relative to what you have searched for.

After you have completed the search, you navigate the results and determine the best resource that matches your initial request.

## The Essence of Search Engine Optimisation

The aim of your website is to make search engines understand that you are an __authority__ on the services you offer. You do this by talking about your services, what and how you offer them. Adding words to your website on a regular basis helps build this __authority__.

Everything about improving your authority comes back to Content. If you write Good Content you will get more visitors. If you write Good Content more people will share your links, and you will get more visitors. If you update frequently you will have more Good Content, and more more people will share your links, and you will get more visitors.

Your website will be ranked in search results by how much authority you have on a subject. So your website must be updated to stay relevant to people searching for your services.

"The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites." [How Google Search Works] [1]

## Trust the Algorithm

We trust the search engine algorithms to decide what is relevant to the search we have entered. An algorithm decides how to find the __most relevant__ information for you from ever-changing variables, such as how many people clicked a link from a previous search, how many times it falls within a keyword search and if you have searched for that site before.

Making your site easy to be found is therefore going to be a difficult issue to resolve, and stay on-top of over time. It will take time to build a reputation with these search engines because they have seen many websites and domains rise and fall overnight. There is no short cut.

If we choose to subvert the search engine algorithms or sneak into good rankings by means that are disapproved, we can end up on the dark side. Using Black Hat SEO you can end up with some excellent results and see your site at the top but if you get found out, or the search algorithm is changed to catch you cheating, you get penalised and shot down the list.

## Black Hat Operations

The dark underbelly of the internet is filled with vile and disturbing things. A few steps above the underbelly is a term known as SEO. While many who practice the arts of SEO are not familiar with the dark ways, there are few who decide to tread an awfully thin line and delve to areas that we who are upright would rather not let our feet fall.

The promise of magical rankings and an excellent position on search results pages can be enough to entice us to the dark side. It all sounds so wonderful, but sometimes the price is the blacklist or red marks around your pages that warn customers away from you and your business. So be careful where you place your feet.

## The Long Term

Search Engine Optimisation is a long-term investment, with no quick solutions. The risk is too great for getting good results too fast. By following the process below you can avoid the blacklist and build a great reputation for your website with search algorithms.

* Make the code friendly for search engines to read what your site is saying. This helps the robots who browse your website to find what they are looking for;
* Change and Update your website, so the search engine algorithms will think it is relevant to content for which people are searching;
* Write good content to engage people and help them to share it.
