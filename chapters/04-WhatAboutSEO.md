# What About SEO (Not that there's anything wrong with that)

In which we discuss Search Engine Optimisation, the good, the bad and the ugly.


Search Engine Optimisation is the process of moving your site up the result list, hopefully onto the first page, without exchanging money directly with the search engine company to be displayed there. 

People searching for information prefer to find information on sites that display naturally in the top results and will refrain from clicking links that have been chosen or paid to be listed at the top of the search results. For this reason it is best to invest in your site to bring you good results and good returns.

To boil down Search Engine Optimisation into a three step process, just to get started, would look something like this:

* Create a site that is easy to index so your website can be searched by the "bots" that remember information for search engines;
* Update the content so the search engines know you are still relevant;
* Create site content that is compelling to read so people pass on links to your website.

## How Does Searching Work

When you begin a search for some information you start with a few words in a small text box. From these few words you started with the Search Engine has to go and find a small list of sites that best match those terms for you. Each search engine matches the terms differently to another.

From a small amount of words the Search Engine has to trawl through a lot of content to generate results. Through the use of analysis and algorithms the search engine connects the dots and presents you with a list of websites that it deems relate to what you have searched for.

After you have completed the search you navigate the results and determine the best resource that matches your initial request.

## The Essence of Search Engine Optimisation

What we aim to do with your site is to make the search engines understand that your website is an __authority__ on any subject that you would like people to find your business by. This means that you need to have words that talk about what you offer, how you approach it and in what location you work.

By default your website should be an authority on your business name, but we need to extend the reach of the search so people do not need to know about your business to find it. This means we need to talk about your services, locations, professionalism in ways that people find interesting and want to share.

People will be trying to find your site with words. You need to provide words that speak to the services you offer in an effort to be found. These words then become an authority and your site links are shared at various media sites. These things all work together to build you up as a source of information on your services, which the machines notices with their algorithms.

"The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites." [How Google Search Works] [1]

## Trust the Machines

We trust machines and algorithms decide what is relevant to the search we have entered. It is not a hand picked decision made by a man hiding behind a curtain, an algorithm decides from ever-changing variables how to find the __most relevant__ information for you. How many clicked that link from a previous search, how many times is falls within a keyword search, if you have searched for that site before.

A thirst for knowledge drives us to computers that process vast amounts of information and feedback a list of sites that may be of interest based on a few keywords we have provided. If you think about the information floating on the internet these algorithms must be complex to connect the dots and give us results within a few seconds.

Making your site easy to be found is therefore going to be a difficult issue to resolve - if you want to remain on the "Good" side of the (search engine) Force. It will take time to build reputation with these machines because they have seen many websites and domains rise and fall; populated with huge amounts of data and comments overnight; or single page sites that have never been updated.

If we choose to subvert their algorithms or sneak into good rankings by means they will disapprove of we can end up on the dark side. Using Black Hat SEO you can end up with some excellent results and see your site at the top, but if you get found out, or the algorithm is changed to catch you cheating you get banned and shot down the list.

## Black Hat Operations

The dark underbelly of the internet is filled with vile and disturbing things, a few steps above the underbelly is a term known as SEO. While many who practice the arts of SEO are not familiar with the dark ways, there are few who decide to tread an awfully thin line and delve to areas that we who are upright would rather not let our feet fall.

They promise magical rankings and excellent position on search results pages. It all sounds wonderful, but sometimes the price is the blacklist or red marks around your pages that warn customers away from you and your business. So be careful where you place your feet.

We look at SEO by making the code correct for search engines to read what your site is saying. This means that the robots who browse your website, and there will be many, can help real people find what they are looking for. The more changes there are the more the robot will think it to be relevant to what people are searching for.
