# Content

In which we discuss, arguably, the most important aspect of your website.


## What is Content?
Content is the word we use to speak about images, photos, logos and words. Content is what we provide to the users reading the website and while design makes the delivery of the content more digestible there is no substitute for quality content built by your company.

## Content Makes the World Go Around

Content makes the world go round. It is the thirst for knowledge that will bring people to your website to find out about you. The design and layout will help them connect with your business, but they stay to read the content and find out more about you. That is why we focus on content and how people will be reading that on the website.

What you may not know is that the web is a platform for providing content. Behind the talk of attractive layouts, excellent development techniques and whizz-bang animation is the simple fact that the web is a content delivery platform. If your website looks nice and fancy but says nothing then the paths to your business being found on the internet are going to be few and narrow.

We make sure what the search engines see is simple and easy for them to understand by following a few main protocols with the code:
Good headings, good tags, semantic code layout. Besides those few things the search engines are going to search and index your content to associate it with other people's searches. This is why we talk a lot about Content (note the capital "C" there).

What this means is that the main path to be found is up to the words on your website. A static website is a great brochure, but a constantly updated website increases the chance for your website being found. It shows that you are still relevant as a business and that the site is being used. The best thing you can do once you have a website is to have other people use it; direct existing clients to it, get links pointing to it.

The next thing is to update the content, just like you frequently have some news to report your website should have regular news as well. These updates may not be about the company directly, but about the industry you are in. These words will associate you business with the industry you are in and thus relate your company and website to the world at large, hopefully showing the searching engines that you know what you are talking about.

Make sure that the articles are written and not copied or plagiarised as this may not work with search engines getting smarter how they rank sites.

The regular updating of content works in a few ways with search engines:

* Shows that the website is being used and that the information is relevant;
* Adds more key words to the website - these are associated words that helps Search Engines find your site;
* Shows that you are a respectable source of information within your profession;
* Increases the likelihood that your website will be shared from people not associated with your business.

# Keywords

Back in the early days of search engines we used meta tags to identify websites to search engines. Meta tags are computer read elements included in the code at the top of the web page. Old search engines would find sites on the internet, store the meta information and then use that when people entered a search term so they could return a list of results faster.

When Google started they changed the way information was gathered; they ignored the meta information and stored information from inside the html body. This is why Google became so popular, because they ignored the hidden information which could contain misleading information and made the search results dependant on the content of the page. People could search and read information on the topic they searched.

The inclusion of meta information is important for some aspects of good rankings, but keywords are not included in good rankings. Now the term "Keywords" refers to the targeted words you use and reuse within your site that you want clients to find you with.

Keywords are within you content, not hidden in pages. This elevates the importance of content and good writing within your website, adding items to it and updating with new content relevant to your industry.

Computer storage is cheaper and computers are faster, so they use an algorithm to read sites and then remember them on their servers. This algorithm takes different parts of the site: the header in the top of the web browser, the title on the page, the content on the site. These factors and many more, are all part of the secret sauce that becomes a search engine and how you get results.

The focus on "keywords" in website marketing should make you think of your website content and good writing. Remember, [Google Does not use Keywords Meta Tag] [1].

## Content is King

The content is the important part. While the headers and hidden html code goes into the secret sauce it is the content which is the King. Because the content is the meat between the bread, it is what speaks your business proposition, your sales and marketing, it is where the most focus should go.

The content is pulled apart by the search engines and checked against what has been searched on. If it is forced, things seem a little forced to a specific point with your use of words, it is considered fake and ranked down. If it is repeated words with no sentences it is ranked down.

Content should be natural. Like with a conversation you can tell a person will go on and on (and on and on) about themselves, it is the same when a search engine reads your website. Be natural in your approach to selling services to your region, it may be a machine algorithm parsing your site, but it has been built and adjusted to find information for humans.

## Web Strategy

Considering that Content should frequently be added to your site a good strategy for updating your site will be necessary. It helps you to think of it as an ongoing project, after all it is a marketing platform you have created. You need to think of your website as a priority to get the best returns from it.

Either internal or external staff are required to keep the ship moving forward, because if Content is King then you need to be writing and updating and making sure everything sticks to The Message.

Web Strategy is import to a web site you want to see results because Real People are writing Real Articles that are Really being Shared. Over time you become a voice in the industry and your location.

### The Message

The Message is where you want to see results. For the month of November you want to see people reading articles about your Major Service, so you write one a week and post it a link to it on Facebook and Twitter. You find how to write articles on other sites, in a link exchange or as a guest writer, that link back to your pages. You talk about it internally so that people share it on their Twitter or Facebook.

The Message is a focus for your strategy and it may take a while to see decent results. Remember when you are starting that you have zero keywords associated with your site and you are starting from the very bottom. Each campaign you do using The Message will add keywords to your site and help, over time, to boost rankings from those keywords.

These search algorithms have seen many sites and know when you are force-feeding keywords into articles. Take your time building up this keyword infrastructure and focus on helpful, interesting topics that your potential clients will want to read. The aim with The Message is to create an ongoing conversation that clients can associate with and will want to share.

## How Do I "Content"?

Making good content is difficult. Engaging readers is difficult. Writing in a manner that makes people want to share is difficult. But considering the continual flow of information from your website is important in securing a good marketing platform, it must be done. How do you do it though?

### Get a list of topics to write about

Start a discussion in your company about some topics to write about. Think about your services and some questions you have heard from your clients. Is there a point of contention or discussion that frequently arrises in meetings? Is there an issue you have to address frequently? Write them all down, all these are things your clients could be interested in and will make great topics to start writing on.

Think about some terms or topics you would like your website to appear in search results for. Your business may be in OH&S but you might want to be found for searches to do with "consultants" as well as OH&S; write some articles about consultancy, if you can include the region you offer your consultancy services, adding articles like this will associate "consultants" with your business.

From the list you may see some articles that share main topics. Group these article ideas together and write about them in a series of posts. Referencing previous posts will show new readers you have been talking about topics for a longer time. Having content left over will give you nice little teaser tag-lines to leave at the end, encouraging readers to return in a week for the next article.

Once articles are completed remember back to previous discussions, was there a particular client who was asking about the latest topic? The latest article may answer questions a client had recently about one of your services, so write a short email to them explaining what you covered. Send them the link and see what they say, their reply may give you some new ideas for follow up articles.

If you have a mailing list setup on the site you can group a series of excerpts from the latests articles and have that sent to the subscribers. Subscribers will appreciate the email and it may bring a new round of viewers to the site, reading articles they may of missed.

### Get Someone to Write

Now that you have a list of articles to write and good discussions to start you will need someone to write them all for you. This is your choice, you need to find someone who know how to write engaging content, or is willing to give it a go. Someone who has time allocated to create the articles and to keep them relevant to your strategy.

Consider hiring people to accomplish this task directly or external writers can help too. It will change over time as you understand how clients are using your website and you are seeing results, good or bad, coming from what you have done.

#### Freelance Content Writers

Many companies employ external writers to write on their behalf and then publish it on their website. While this will get you good content it can be difficult to prepare a freelancer with all of your information to write on your behalf. You will need to educate them on your business, your company, your approach and how to best represent you.

A good freelance writer will be able to fill gaps of information and research topics to keep content flowing. You may have to shop around to find someone who works well with your business, but removing the continued responsibility of updating your website may be the best way to ensure it is updated.

#### Internal Content Writers

As the business owner, or someone invested in your company, you may spot someone who can write well, it may be yourself who writes well; either way, having an internal staff member write content is a great resource.

Having someone on board do the writing can ease the selection process of finding a freelance writer. They understand how the company works, they can ask questions directly and start discussions about topics they are writing about.

You will need to allocate time and let the staff working on the site understand that it is important. Good content takes time to write. It takes time to analyse what is working and to adapt the writing to get results. You are appointing a staff member to write on behalf of the company and to be a member of the marketing strategy, so ensure they have all they need to do the job properly.

### Don't Overcomplicate

Resist the urge to write complicated articles, unless you are sure that is what your readers are looking for. Keep it easy to read and understand. Remember that clients and potential clients will be reading these articles and some may not have an in-depth understanding of your services.

To cover all client understanding of your services you could always do more in-depth articles that reference the same topic discussed in a simple way. Links to previous articles is a brilliant way to keep your readers on your website for a longer time.

### Make the Content Easy to Read

Big blocks of text can be daunting to read. Break up the text with some images or use block-quotes to highlight main points of your article. A nice layout of your article pages will help readers to stay engaged with what you are writing about. 

Understanding how to layout text nicely in your articles should not be underestimated and could be considered as important as the text itself. You want to ensure there is nothing that turns readers away from what you are showing them.

### Give Readers what They Want

If you notice a particular topic is bringing in readers then keep writing about it. Do not follow plans if a topic is engaging more readers, change to what they want to see. By giving readers what they want you are listening to the market, getting more viewers to your website and increasing the likeliness of being shared about.

Do not assume what your readers are looking for. Engage with them, talk to them, find out ways to get feedback about what you are writing. Allowing readers to influence your Content brings them into the discussion and shows that they are an important part of your website.

## Keep on Going

Good content is difficult to organise but once you have it on your website it is in the right place. Search engines will index your site and associate those words with your business and services. People will search for terms and your site will start to perform well in results.
