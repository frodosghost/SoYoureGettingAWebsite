# Content

This is where we discuss, arguably, the most important aspect of your website.

## What is Content?

Content is on your website consists of images, photos, logos and words. Content is what vistitors read and engage with on your website. Design makes the delivery of the content more digestible, but there is no substitute for quality content built by your company to help people understand what you do and to connect with your business.

## Content Makes the World Go Around

Content makes the world go round. Beautiful design and an engaging layout will help people connect with your business, but they stay to read the content and find out more about you.

The web is a platform for providing content. Behind all of the attractive layouts, excellent development techniques and whizz-bang animation is the simple fact that the web is a content delivery platform. If your website looks nice and fancy but says nothing, then the paths to your business being found on the internet are going to be few and narrow.

Search Engines see differently to human eyes, they trawl thousands of websites and remember headings, tags, words, word placement and the code, which gives us a position of a search results page. A static website is a great brochure, but a constantly updated website has an increased chance of being found.

Just like you frequently have some news to report to your friends, your website should have regular news updates as well. These updates may not be about the company directly, but can also be about the industry you are in. When adding content remember that you are building __authority__ with word association, talk about what is important to you as a business.

## The Ongoing Conversation with your Website

Consider your content as having a conversation with your visitors. Every page of your website is the start of a discussion about a topic. How engaging you are, how informative your page is, how you express and present this content is all part of engaging your visitors and hopefully turning them into clients.

The Ongoing Conversation helps with:

* Showing that the website is being used and that the information is relevant;
* Adding more keywords to the website - these are associated words that helps Search Engines find your site;
* Showing that you are a respectable source of information within your profession;
* Increasing the likelihood that your website will be shared from people not associated with your business.

## Keywords

Back in the early days of search engines, we used meta tags to help search engines identify websites. Meta tags are computer-read elements included in the code at the top of the web page. Old search engines would find sites on the internet, store the meta information and then use that when people entered a search term so they could return a list of results faster.

When Google began, it changed the way information was gathered. Over time the Google algorithm ignored the meta information and stored information from inside the website body. Google became so popular because it ignored the hidden information which could contain misleading information and made the search results dependant on the content of the page. People could search and read information on the topic for which they searched.

Now the term "Keywords" refers to the targeted words you use and reuse within your site, with which you want clients to find you. Keywords are within your content, not hidden in pages. This elevates the importance of good writing. There is a necessity for adding items to your website and updating it with new and improved content relevant to your industry.

The focus on "keywords" in website marketing should make you think of your website content and good writing. Remember, [Google Does not use Keywords Meta Tag] [1]

## Content is King

The content is the important part of being found from a search. While the headers and hidden html code goes into the secret sauce, it is the content which is the King. The content is the meat between the bread, it speaks to your business proposition, your sales and marketing, it is where the most focus should go. We search using words, so it makes sense that words are the most important part of the website.

Content should be natural. As with a conversation, you can tell a person will go on and on (and on and on) about themselves, it is the same when a search engine reads your website. Be natural in your approach to selling services to your region. It may be a machine algorithm parsing your site, but it has been built and adjusted to find information for humans.

Search engines check your content against what has been searched on. If your content seems forced or contrived to a specific point it is considered a false positive and not ranked as high in results.

## Web Strategy

A solid Web Strategy is important to a website if you want to see a return of investment, because on going content and discussion is important to building a platform of authority. Real People are writing Real Articles that are Really being Shared. Over time, you become a voice in your target industry.

Either internal or external staff are required to keep the ship moving forward, because if Content is King then you need to be writing and updating and making sure everything sticks to The Message.

### The Message

The Message is an ongoing discussion you begin from your website. A series of discussion points that you use to build a platform of authority. The Message is a campaign, a point of focus for your advertising. One product at a time you build a series of articles or posts to show that you know and understand your business.

Regular and varied posts on the same topic will build a repository of knowledge associated with your website. Over time search engines will trust the knowledge coming from your website and recommend you by ranking you higher.

It will take a while to see decent results after beginning a discussion on a topic, you are starting with zero keywords associated with your website. Each campaign you do pertaining to The Message will add keywords to your site and help, over time, to boost rankings from those keywords.

Search algorithms have indexed many sites and know when you are force-feeding keywords into articles. Take your time building up keywords and focus on helpful, interesting topics that your potential clients will want to read. The aim with The Message is to create an Ongoing Conversation that clients can associate with and will want to share.

## How Do I "Content"?

Making good content is difficult. Engaging readers is difficult. Writing in a manner that makes people want to share is difficult. The continual flow of information from your website is important, for securing a good marketing platform - but how do you do it though?

### Get a list of topics to write about

Start a discussion within your company about some topics to write about. Think about your services and some questions you have heard from your clients. Is there a point of contention or discussion that frequently arises in meetings? Is there an issue you have to address often? Write them all down. These are things your clients could be interested in and will make great topics to start writing about.

Think about some terms or topics you would like your website to appear in through online searches. Your business may be in OH&S but you might want to be found for searches to do with "consultants" as well as OH&S. Write some articles about consultancy. If you can, include the region in which you offer your consultancy services. Adding articles like this will associate "consultants" with your business.

You may see some article ideas that share topics, group these article ideas together and write about them in a series of posts. Referencing previous posts will show new readers you have been talking about topics for a longer time. Having content to tackle on an ongoing basis can help you to encourage readers to return in a week for the next article.

Once articles are completed, think back to previous discussions. Was there a particular client who was asking about the latest topic? The latest article may answer questions a client had recently about one of your services, so write a short email to them explaining what you covered. Send them the link and see what they say. Their reply may give you some new ideas for follow-up articles.

Focus on a single topic at a time, and make that focus extend over a few months. Don't try and advertise everything you do all at once, the more topics you talk about to more convoluted your message is.

If you have a mailing list setup on the site, you can group a series of excerpts from the latest articles and have that sent to the subscribers. They will appreciate the email and it may bring a new round of viewers to the site, reading articles they may have missed.

### Get Someone to Write

Now that you have a list of articles to write and good discussions to start, you will need someone to write them all for you. This is your choice. You need to find someone who knows how to write engaging content or will give it a go. It should be someone who has time allocated to create the articles and can keep them relevant to your strategy.

Consider using staff you already have, hiring people to accomplish this task or use freelance writers to help write. You can always change writers over time as you understand how clients are using your website and you are seeing results, good or bad, coming from what has been published.

#### Freelance Content Writers

Many companies employ external writers to write on their behalf and then publish it on their website. While this will get you good content, it can be difficult to prepare a freelancer with all of your information to write on your behalf. You will need to educate them on your business, your company, your approach and how to best represent you.

A good freelance writer will be able to fill gaps of information and research topics to keep content flowing. You may have to shop around to find someone who works well with your business. Removing the continued responsibility of updating your website for an internal resource may be the best way to ensure it is updated.

#### Internal Content Writers

As the business owner you may know of a staff member who enjoys writing, or you can undertake this task of writing for your website. Having someone in the business who can do the writing eases the selection process of finding a freelance writer. There are other benefits to having staff write for you:

* Staff understand the business from the inside;
* Staff can ask questions directly when unsure about topic;
* Staff can start internal discussions based on the topics they are writing about, which encourages more involvement in the process.

You will need to allocate time and make sure the staff working on the site understands that it is important. Good content takes time to write. It takes time to analyse what is working and to adapt the writing to get results. You are appointing a staff member to write on behalf of the company and to be a member of the marketing strategy, so ensure they have all they need to do the job properly.

### Don't Overcomplicate

Resist the urge to write complicated articles unless you are sure that is what your readers are looking for. Keep it easy to read and understand. Remember that clients and potential clients will be reading these articles and some may not have an in-depth understanding of your services.

To cover all client understanding of your services, you could always do more in-depth articles that reference the same topic discussed in a simple way. Links to previous articles is a brilliant way to keep your readers on your website for a longer time.

### Make the Content Easy to Read

Big blocks of text can be daunting to read. Break up the text with some images or use block-quotes to highlight main points of your article. A nice layout of your article pages will help readers to stay engaged with what you are writing about.

Understanding how to layout text nicely in your articles should not be underestimated and could be considered as important as the text itself. You want to ensure there is nothing that turns readers away from what you are showing them.

### Give Readers what They Want

If you notice a particular topic is bringing in readers then keep writing about it. If a topic is engaging readers, be flexible in your schedule and write more on what they want to see. By giving readers what they want you are listening to the market, getting more viewers to your website and increasing the likeliness of having links shared.

Do not assume what your readers are looking for. Engage with them, talk to them and find out ways to get feedback about what you are writing. Allowing readers to influence your Content brings them into the discussion and shows that they are an important part of your website.

## Keep on Going

Good content is difficult to organise but once you have it on your website it is in the right place. Search engines will index your site and associate those words with your business and services. People will search for terms and your site will start to perform well in results.
