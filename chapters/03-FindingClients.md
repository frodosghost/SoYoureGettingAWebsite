# Finding Clients

In this chapter, we discuss the methods and ideas behind getting clients.

A website is a great platform to show off your company or product. It is a great way to connect with your clients and present something that people are looking for. But to re-iterate, it is not a magical tool that makes customers appear from thin air.

Clients are attracted to companies that display the same values they believe in. That is why a website is an important and now essential tool to have in your belt. Trusting the website to bring you clients however, is like trusting a hammer to be every tool a carpenter needs to do the job. The hammer may get the job done on occasion, at other times you will be bewildered as to why it is not working.

A website should fit within your current marketing scheme. Using your website as a single tool, within an entire suite of available options, will help you to consider as an option with a specific target and usage. Just like the hammer metaphor above, your website is a tool with a specific usage.

> A well-oiled marketing machine has many cogs. Your website is just one of them.

## Word of Mouth Still Rules the Roost

Your best and most successful way of finding clients will still come from word-of-mouth. It is the best and most flattering way to accumulate clients and, with your normal client screening process, should should reward you with some good, long term clients.

Word-of-mouth is when you work for a client and they like what you do so much that they recommend you to a friend or someone who asks about the services you offer. It is how we find our most important personal connections, from doctors to good friends. Endorsement is a very powerful advertisement.

This is the best kind of marketing. It's free and based on the existing services you offer. Look after these clients, because word will get around and you will end up with a fantastic list of clients that will grow like a ripple effect in a pond.

There are exceptions to this, but for most smaller businesses it is the general rule.

### So why do you need a website if you get the majority of your clients through referrals?

A website shows that your business exists. If you do not show up in any search results when someone is looking for your services then you are missing out on potential revenue. Having a website gives you a chance to be seen.

It gives your business an easy way to share information. Instead of printing off large brochures, you can direct people to you site for the same information that can be kept updated. By putting your information onto a website you are publishing a canonical source of information about your business.

The locale of your business might not matter, so by having a website you give yourself a potential client base that exists within the whole world.

Even if you do not invest millions of dollars into a site to start off with, you can still get a feel for how the internet works and how you can exist within it. Over time you can expand your business and use the website as a source of revenue. Your website does not have to be the best thing since sliced bread when it is first published. You can update, change, grow or shift online when-ever you want to.

## It Takes Time to Understand

Not many websites have the immediate money earning potential. It takes time for a website to find its footing, for you to learn how your clients will use the site and where to put money in to make it better. It will take time to learn how to make improvements that will engage your clients. Every site is different.

Do not be discouraged by a poorly performing website. Do some investigation, find how to make it better and find how to connect with your clients. You will be more likely to find clients when you learn how to speak and connect with them.

Most of the time we have to change how we perceive our clients are thinking. We need to unlearn the misconceptions we have about our clients and learn to listen to them. Don't think on behalf of clients but learn how to have a conversation with them.

## The Best Sites Change with the Times

A very small percentage of sites will "go viral". Some of us will have to suffer taking the hard road to generate a small income from our website. It will be a small income if we are lucky too. The majority of businesses will have to spend time and effort making a site that potentially few people will find.

It is depressing to think of the numbers. Very early on we may be lucky to see any clients find our sites, most of the people who will see our brand new website will be family and friends. There is always a long road ahead of us, but leaving a site to go stale will only accelerate the process of sinking the ship.

Stale websites fade from search engine ranking systems and appear uncared for. There is nothing worse than finding a really good article, only to find they have not updated the site in the past seven months. Good, fresh content changes should happen regularly, other wise your business has the appearance of being disconnected.

Always keep your site up-to-date. It shows clients that you care about connecting with them. Check your analytics to see where clients are going on your site and improve those pages. Remove or improve the dark corners that aren't getting visitors. Be mindful of your website and you will appear mindful of your clients and help them to connect with you.

Design refreshes and small changes to the layout will keep your regular visitors looking for new content within your site. Just like changes in a static display at your local supermarket will make you look twice and take notice, so will small changes to your site.

## How about the Tyre Kickers?

Tyre Kickers are people who are window shopping but not making commitments to using your services. They visit your site but don't fill out forms or send emails. One of the problems here is that we can never tell the serious clients from those who were never intending to buy.

Tyre kickers include:

* People who were going to use your information;
* People who are on the fence and not sure;
* Those who were never going to use your services.

It may feel like the Tyre Kickers are a waste of are wasting your resources. Even with all the helpful articles you spend hours crafting and the resources you put together to share with them, they never go a step further to share with their friends. When you check your tracking information it appears that you are doing little to attract more followers.

There will always be freeloaders, but if you change how you think about them, maybe you can earn their trust. But maybe you could use them as a test bed for making engaging changes to your website.

Consider these tyre kickers as a target market and try to change little things to connect with them. Use analytics to find out which pages the search engines are directing people to. Update little panels to include great [Microcopy] [1], which helps to answer questions these people may have. Update your content to check if it is flat, or disengaging, in specific areas. Try testing different landing pages to see if you get a different reaction.

## Path of Least Resistance

We like overcomplicating solutions. We like offering a website that is large because we think that our potential clients will visit every page before using us a s a service provider.

In reality, web searching is a fickle experience. Clients can walk away from your site because it is not colourful enough or because it is too colourful. They can walk away because the text is too small or the site design isn't polished enough by their standards. Many people can walk away because a site is too complicated.

Trust that your clients will read everything about you to make a sound decision, but make sure you offer the path of least resistance for making contact with you. Consider creating a mailing list with your latest updates excerpted in a monthly email. Include special offers to only mailing list subscribers to encourage people to give you their email address.

The process of turning an unknown website visitor into a piece of contact information, either email or phone number, is generally known as “converting” (as taken from [Conversion Marketing] [2]). Your main aim of advertising is to convert the website visitors into paying clients. If your business is based on long-term engagement, then consider trying to take some contact details in a mailing list, or something similar.

Your website should facilitate contact, not hinder it. Your website should encourage sharing and not hide it below unimportant information. Do not complicate the simple focus of converting visitors into clients. Over time you should iron out the complexities and aim to make the website a simple tool for having clients get in contact with you.

## What Does Social Media have to Do With This?

Social Media is essentially a platform to gain relationships and have conversations with anyone. It can grow into a sizeable internal department, or be managed by the business owner. Which ever way you use it, it should not be ignored when moving online with your business. There are many professionals that will tell you how to use social media successfully and get good results from it.

Use common sense when getting into the world of Social Media. Make sure that you consider who has access within your company to post on social media, keep it current with what you are posting and direct people to your website.

Remember that while you can build a large profile on social media sites, your are not in control of how they manage their service. In agreeing to their terms and conditions, you have subjected your advertising, discussions and brand to their business decisions. When they change something, it could change how you run your marketing, and while you may be happy to run inside their structure, you should always be aware of how this affects your business.

Invest in social media but make sure that it leads people back to the canonical source of information about your company and website.
