# Introduction

## Congratulations

First off, let us be the first to congratulate you on deciding to get a website. Reaching as many people online is a fantastic thing to do and we are glad that you have taken the first steps in getting a place on the internet to call your own.

This booklet aims to guide you on the choices you have to make. It will help to give you tips on getting started with a owning your website. We hope to give you enough information to make you feel comfortable with bringing this new place to life and thinking of it as an important part of your business.

## What is the Internet?

The internet is a source of information. It is a tool for learning and studying. It is a series of connected computers, users and information that can all be represented and accessed from almost every place around the world.

The Internet is a vast landscape existing in a digital world; a place to hide and a place to explore. It is a wonderful and dangerous tool in the hands of humankind. It brings us together or separates us more than any technology has done in the past.

The internet is a place like home or a place to do business. It is a place to make connections with new people, clients or strangers.

## What is a Website?

If the Internet is a digital world then your website is like your place of business. You have a shop front, which is welcoming to new and existing clients; and you have the inside which contains information about your company, your products and information about them.

If you choose, your website can also facilitate sales or customer relationship management. It can be as big or as small as your need or desire to make it work as part of your business.

## What is the point of reading this pamphlet?

I have accumulated many hours talking to clients about websites and how they can be used for business purposes. Many people expect it to be easy to get great returns. After all, "everyone on the internet is making money", right?

The road to making a good website starts with understanding the ecosystem into which you are extending your business. The world wide web is expanding, changing and adapting everyday. You are thinking of including yourself in the ecosystem and it's wise to understand some fundamentals before getting started.

In reading this, we hope that you can gain some knowledge on a few points:

* What goes into making a good website;
* Your role in making your website successful;
* The amount of ongoing work necessary for maintaining your website;
* How choosing a web company is only the start of a good business relationship.

Some of these points are literally written in this pamphlet and can be references on page and line numbers; others are information you should learn by reading and visualising your part of the ecosystem that changes everyday. I cannot impart all my knowledge to you, but I can give you the beginnings and you can go from there.
