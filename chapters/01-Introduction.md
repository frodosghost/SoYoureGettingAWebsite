## What is the Internet?

The Internet is a source of information. It is a tool for learning and studying. It is a series of connected computers, users and information that can all be represented and accessed from almost every place around the world.

The Internet is a vast landscape existing in a digital world. A place to hide and a place to explore. It is a wonderful and dangerous tool in the hands of humankind. No technology in the past has brought us together or pushed us apart as much as the internet has.

The Internet is a place like home or a place to do business. It is a place to make connections with new people, clients and/or strangers.

## What is a Website?

If the Internet is a digital world then your website is like your place of business. You have a shop front, which is welcoming to new and existing clients, and you have the inside which contains information about your company, your products and information about them.

If you choose, your website can also facilitate sales, like a shop front, or be your customer relationship management system. It can be as big or as small as your need or desire to make it work as part of your business.
