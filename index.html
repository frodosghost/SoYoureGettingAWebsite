<a id="about-this-book" class="anchor" href="#about-this-book" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About this Book</h2>

<p>This book has been made over time as we have been responding to clients questions about getting a website and what they should be aware of. It has grown as a resource and we wanted to make it available to clients before they were getting started with a new website.</p>

<h2>
<a id="why" class="anchor" href="#why" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why?</h2>

<p>I have spent hours writing emails to clients detailing the ins-and-outs of gaining returns for the websites I have created for them. After a while I knew I writing the same things over and over again and it was time to put the words into one place, with the aim of becoming a pamphlet I can hand out to clients before we work together.</p>

<h2>
<a id="what" class="anchor" href="#what" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What?</h2>

<p>Owning a website is hard work, especially if you expect it to bring returns. I have found that clients expect a website to do all the work for them, without realising it is just another tool in their marketing strategy; You only get out of it what you put into it. Just getting a website online is not a magic bullet solution to attracting clients, it is when the hard work actually begins.</p>

<p>It can be nicer to know the number of circles you must pass through to get to the centre, this pamphlet aims to explain - in some broad sense - the depths of work required to get a website to be an excellent marketing tool, rather than a mediocre business site.</p>
