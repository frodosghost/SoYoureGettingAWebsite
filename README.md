# So You're Getting a Website

## Why?

I have spent hours writing emails to clients detaling the ins-and-outs of gaining returns for the websites I have created for them. After a while I knew I writing the same things over and over again and it was time to put the words into one place, with the aim of becoming a pamphlet I can hand out to clients before we work together.

## What?

Owning a website is hard work, especially if you expect it to bring returns. I have found that clients expect a website to do all the work for them, without realising it is just another tool in their marketing strategy; You only get out of it what you put into it. Just getting a website online is not a magic bullet solution to attracting clients, it is when the hard work actually begins.

It can be nicer to know the number of circles you must pass through to get to the centre, this pamphlet aims to explain - in some broad sense - the depths of work required to get a website to be an excellent marketing tool, rather than a medicore business site.
